					<h2>What's New In Node.js&nbsp;9.0.0</h2>
					<P>Rich Trott / @Trott</p>
					<aside class="notes">Node.js 9.0.0 was released on Halloween 2017. You can read the change log or the official blog post about it, but hey, somehow you ended up here! So instead, you get my opinions on what’s important about Node.js 9.0.0!</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>⚠️ Caution ⚠️</h2>
					<p>9.0.0 is not slated for LTS.</p>
					<aside class="notes">9.0.0 will not be a long-term support (LTS) release. So you will likely want to move to 10.0.0 in April 2018. That release will be part of LTS and will be supported for about 2.5 years.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>⚠️ Caution ⚠️</h2>
					<p>I'm doing the best I can.</p>
					<aside class="notes">I won’t be covering everything, of course. (That’s what the change log is for.) These are the highlights from my point of view. If I missed something you care deeply about, sorry! Feel free to let me know, though, so I can do a better job in 6 months when 10.0.0 comes out!</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>V8 6.2</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Node.js 9.0.0 ships with V8 6.2 and all the delicious performance improvements it brings with it to the party. If you are the type of person who cares about performance improvements to Object.toString() and ES6 Proxy objects, then V8 6.2 has you covered. There’s also new features for regular expressions, longer permissible string lengths, and other esoterica. All you really need to know is: Your code will probably run a bit faster in Node.js 9.0.0.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>npm 5.5.1</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Updating to the latest npm when using older Node.js versions is not typically much of a problem: npm install -g npm</p>
						<p>But if you use whatever npm ships with Node.js and if you haven’t yet updated to Node.j 8.9.0 (because it too came out on October 31, 2017), then this will be your opportunity to get the new stuff. There’s lots of security stuff in npm 5.5.1, including two-factor authentication!</p>
						<p>If you have updated to Node.js 8.9.0, you already have npm 5.5.1</p>
					</aslide>	
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>http2 unflagged</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						This happened in the 8.x.x release line, but it’s big enough that I’m including it here anyway. http2 is no longer behind a command-line flag. It’s available out of the box. It’s still experimental, though, so use with caution. But if faster website loading and all the other http2 features and benefits are your jam, then there you have it!
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Enhanced Error objects</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I have to admit, I’ve been on the fence about this one. It won’t affect Error objects generated by V8 (like a typical SyntaxError) but for Error objects generated by Node.js, you will now have access to some extra information. The most interesting (to me) is a code property.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre class="hljs">
try {
  Buffer.from({});
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.code); // 'ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE'
}
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The code property is intended to be a permanent identifier for a class of errors. The same error will have the same code in different versions of Node.js. The associated message, on the other hand, may change from version to version of Node.js.</p>
						<p>The upshot is this: If you happen to check error messages either as part of tests or as part of actual production code (!!!), consider checking the code value instead!</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>http 400 Bad Request</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Previously, parse errors on HTTP requests resulted in the server closing the connection. Now, it sends a 400 Bad Request response.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>assert improvements</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Lots of fixes to assert.deepStrictEqual() so that your deeply nested objects with Symbol properties will be treated correctly.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Goodbye, VS 2013!</h2>
					<aside class="notes">If you compile native addons, use Visual Studio 2015 or newer.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>util.isDeepStrictEqual()</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Lots of libraries like lodash implement a form of deep equality. Node.js needs this functionality for assert, so now in Node.js 9.0.0, it is exposed as util.isDeepStrictEqual().</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Q & A&hellip;</h2>
					<p>&hellip;is usually terrible so we'll be skipping it.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Questions?</h2>
					<p>Come and talk to me or find me on Twitter or something.</p>

					<h2>Thanks!</h2>
